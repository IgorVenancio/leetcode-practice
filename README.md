# LeetCode Practice Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems, written in **C#**.

## üìö Purpose

I'm using this repository to **practice Data Structures and Algorithms**.  
The goal is to improve my problem-solving skills and get better at writing clean, efficient code.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How I Work

- I try to **solve each problem on my own first**.
- Then, I use an **AI assistant** as a tutor to help me refactor or optimize the code.
- I **study the suggestions**, apply the improvements manually, and upload the **final version only**.

## ‚úÖ Notes

Some of the improvements were made with guidance from an AI assistant.  
However, all code is written, reviewed, and understood by me.  
This repository is part of my personal learning process and growth as a developer.
